Solution of Equation
Let's solve a linear equation problem using recursion. You are given a number 
n
 and a value 
z
. Equation is such that x1 + x2 + x3+...+xn = z, where x1, x2, x3, ..xn can take several non negative integral values such that the sum is equal to z. 

  Example:
  n = 3, z = 1
  x1 + x2 + x3 = 1
  Number of possible solution are : 
  (0 0 1), (0 1 0), (1 0 0)
  Total number of possible solutions are 3

Your task is to find total number of solutions for given 
n
 and 
z
.

Input
First line contains an integer T, no of test cases. Then follows 
T
 test cases. Each test case consists of two variables 
n
 and 
z
.

Output
Print 
T
 values, count of possible solutions for each test case.
